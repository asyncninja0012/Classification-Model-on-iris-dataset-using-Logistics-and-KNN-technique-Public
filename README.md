Summary

Import the required library in the jupyer notebook and load the iris dataset.
Check the null values and analyze the features of the data set
Did the data visualization using pairplot and boxplot
Check the corelation through the heatmap.
Split the data set in 70:30 ration for training and testing the model.
Used the KNN to create the model for k=7 on train data set and predict the value of target of test data set.
Check the accuracy and MSE (mean squared error) for both the data set and plot the confussion matrix.
Now, Used the Logistic regression to create the model on train data set and predict the value of target of test data set.
Check the accuracy and the classification report for both the data set and plot the confussion matrix.
